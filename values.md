PySimpleGUI openCV YOLO Deep Learning GUI

[features]
* Shows how to create an AI object identification GUI application
* Identifies objects as per YOLO library
* Teaches going from a command line OpenCV application to an entirely window-based
* Use as a starting point for other AI projects that are command line projects


[extras]
## Running the Demos
  
You will need to pip install openCV and PySimpleGUI
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install pysimplegui
```

Run any of the .py files in the top level directory:
```
yolo.py - single image processing
yolo_video.py Video display
yolo_video_with_webcam.py - webcam or file source. Option to write to hard drive
```
And you'll need the training data.  It's 242 MB and too large for GitHub:
